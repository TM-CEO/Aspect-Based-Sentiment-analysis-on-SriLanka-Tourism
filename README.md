# 🇱🇰 Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis for Sri Lankan Tourism

This project applies **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)** on reviews related to Sri Lankan tourism.  
It identifies key aspects of tourist experiences and analyzes the sentiment associated with each aspect, helping to better understand and enhance the tourism sector.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **Notebook**: `ABSA_Final_Model_for_Total_Reviews.ipynb`

## 🛠️ Methods and Techniques

- Preprocessing of tourist reviews (cleaning, tokenization, etc.)
- Aspect extraction from text data
- Sentiment classification for each aspect
- Model building using machine learning techniques
- Evaluation and visualization of results

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Key Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `sklearn`
  - `nltk`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `tensorflow` or `keras` (if deep learning models are used)

Install necessary libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk matplotlib seaborn tensorflow
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Open the `ABSA_Final_Model_for_Total_Reviews.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or VS Code.
4. Run all cells step-by-step to preprocess the data, train the ABSA model, and view the results.

## 📊 Key Insights

- Extraction of specific aspects (e.g., hospitality, food, transportation, natural attractions) from reviews.
- Sentiment trends for each aspect, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement in Sri Lankan tourism.
- Potential for data-driven decision making to improve the tourist experience.

## ✨ Notes

- You may need a dataset of Sri Lankan tourism reviews to replicate or extend the analysis.
- Feel free to enhance the model with more advanced NLP techniques like BERT or LSTM for better performance.
